# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This is a training project. The main goal is to perform the following actions using new skills and knowledge:
  - create database and tables;
  - import data from CSV to the newly created database and tables;
  - clean data;
  - answer questions;
  - find new insights from the data;
  - QA data;
  - create ERD.


## Process
  1. Creating a database and tables. I created a database and tables using the pgAdmin interface, where I specified formats and constraints. 
  2. Downloading and examining CSV files: Before importing data into the database, I "pre-cleaned" it (trimmed, removed duplicates, etc.) in Google Spreadsheets. For more details, please take a look at cleaning_data.md.
  3. Cleaning and normalization (3NF): removing duplicated rows and columns, formatting, identifying Primary and Foreign keys, verifying data, and deleting improper data. Please take a look at cleaning_data.md.
  4. Answering questions:
  5.
